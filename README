NAME
    Devel::Cover::Report::Json_detailed - Generate a comprehensive JSON file
    articulating the full contents of a coverage run.

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This is an attempt at extracting the contents of a "Devel::Coverage"
    "DB" into a more useful format for the web.

      cover -report json_detailed

    Emits:

      cover_db/cover_detailed.json

    Which has at present the following data structure:

      {
        report_format => '0.1.0',
        branches => {
          some_file => [ @list_of_branch_reports ],
          some_file => [ @list_of_branch_reports ],
        },
        runs => [ @list_of_run_reports ],
        statements => {
          some_file => [ @list_of_statement_reports ],
          some_file => [ @list_of_statement_reports ],
        },
        subs => {
          some_file => [ @list_of_sub_reports ],
          some_file => [ @list_of_sub_reports ],
        },
        summary => { ??? },
      }

    Though its very experimental because I'm still working out how the
    (Undocumented) guts of "Devel::Cover" works.
